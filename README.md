# mnhn-internship_DeepCNN_ChIP-seq

This repository contains code written during my internship at Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle.
You may find python code to read fastq files and train a CNN to classify reads from different files.
The purpose was originally to identify ChIP binding sites, but it can be applied to a wider range of tasks.
